# Summary of Findings

1.	County poverty rates in 2018: In 2018, the 10 counties with the highest poverty rates were located primarily in South Dakota and southern states, including Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama. Todd County, SD, had the highest poverty rate (55.10%). The difference in poverty rates between the highest and tenth highest counties, 13.35%, indicates that these top ten counties may be significant outliers from the rest of the county poverty rates. The analysis also indicates that the total population for each of the top ten counties is fairly small (range of 2055 to 18,075). These small county population sizes are common for rural areas, but the small sample size does indicate that (1) a relatively small number of residents experiencing poverty can contribute to very large poverty rates, and extreme differences in county population size make it difficult to reliably compare county poverty rates across the nation.

2.	Nationwide spatial analysis of county poverty rates: Mapping county poverty rates using distribution categories shows clear geographic trends in poverty experiences. Geographic regions that have long been plagued with high poverty rates continue to have much higher rates compared to the national county average. In particular, the Mississippi Delta, Cotton Belt, Western Appalachia, and Southwestern and Great Plains tribal communities have outsized poverty rates. Overall poverty rates are below average in the mid-Atlantic metropolitan area, which could indicate that an outsized population of higher income residents reside there. Further, the Northern and Central Great Plains are speckled with counties with poverty rates much lower than average. These may be communities where large natural resource or agriculture operations increase income opportunity, or they may be places where wealthy outdoor recreationalists reside. Overall, this data visualization hides the communities where large numbers of people experiencing poverty are offset by highly populated, affluent areas. Finally, on this map, many communities with lower populations may appear to have significantly better or worse poverty conditions compared to counties with larger populations and more economic diversity to modulate poverty rates.
