# Summary of Findings

### Summary of National Poverty and Inequality Findings

1.	County poverty rates in 2018: In 2018, the 10 counties with the highest poverty rates were located primarily in South Dakota and southern states, including Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama. Todd County, SD, had the highest poverty rate (55.10%).

  1.	Todd County, South Dakota             	55.10
  2.	Jefferson County, Mississippi         	49.72
  3.	Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota    	49.32
  4.	East Carroll Parish, Louisiana        	48.63
  5.	Mellette County, South Dakota         	48.32
  6.	Jackson County, South Dakota          	47.74
  7.	Corson County, South Dakota           	44.25
  8.	Claiborne County, Mississippi         	44.04
  9.	Holmes County, Mississippi            	43.58
  10.	Perry County, Alabama                 	41.75

The difference in poverty rates between the highest and tenth highest counties, 13.35%, indicates that these top ten counties may be significant outliers from the rest of the county poverty rates. The analysis also indicates that the total population for each of the top ten counties is fairly small (range of 2055 to 18,075). These small county population sizes are common for rural areas, but the small sample size does indicate that (1) a relatively small number of residents experiencing poverty can contribute to very large poverty rates, and extreme differences in county population size make it difficult to reliably compare county poverty rates across the nation.


2.	National spatial analysis of county poverty rates: Mapping county poverty rates using distribution categories shows clear geographic trends in poverty experiences. Geographic regions that have long been plagued with high poverty rates continue to have much higher rates compared to the national county average. In particular, the Mississippi Delta, Cotton Belt, Western Appalachia, and Southwestern and Great Plains tribal communities have outsized poverty rates. Overall poverty rates are below average in the mid-Atlantic metropolitan area, and the Northern and Central Great Plains are speckled with counties with poverty rates much lower than average.

Overall, this data visualization hides the communities where large numbers of people experiencing poverty are offset by highly populated, affluent areas. Finally, on this map, many communities with lower populations may appear to have significantly better or worse poverty conditions compared to counties with larger populations and more economic diversity to modulate poverty rates.


3.	National comparison of poverty rate changes from 2012 to 2018:


Top 10 counties by increase in percent poverty:
  1. Jackson County, South Dakota     22.478046
  2. Clinch County, Georgia           17.611842
  3. Cottle County, Texas             16.067033
  4. Jim Hogg County, Texas           15.312270
  5. Perry County, Alabama            14.830037
  6. Leslie County, Kentucky          14.409083
  7. Somervell County, Texas          14.366224
  8. Turner County, Georgia           12.543260
  9. Randolph County, Georgia         11.657655
  10. Issaquena County, Mississippi   11.619374

Top 10 counties by decrease in percent poverty:
  1. Kenedy County, Texas        -21.322551
  2. Esmeralda County, Nevada    -16.985172
  3. Motley County, Texas        -16.027811
  4. Harmon County, Oklahoma     -15.247208
  5. Loup County, Nebraska       -15.203111
  6. San Juan County, Colorado   -14.949258
  7. Hudspeth County, Texas      -14.568698
  8. Baker County, Georgia       -14.519724
  9. Edwards County, Texas       -13.003802
  10. Calhoun County, Florida    -12.560126

The analysis also uses a distributional analysis of county population sizes to explore how changes in poverty rates differ for counties with different population sizes. In general, the largest percentage point changes in poverty occur in counties with populations below 10k, but there are a few counties with populations greater than 10k that experienced percentage point changes in excess of 10 percent. In general, counties with populations above 50k had a few counties with percentage poverty increases nearing 5 percent, and counties also saw percentage point decreases in poverty exceeding 5 percent. These population size limited rankings could be used in the future to explore differences in county-level demographic experiences for counties of different population sizes with large increases or decreases in poverty rates.


4. National spatial comparison of Gini coefficients: The map is designed to identify counties with Gini coefficients that are likely statistically significantly higher or lower than the US Gini coefficient (0.486) (at the 95% confidence interval--although this should be considered a rudimentary comparison rather than a statistical claim). In general, regions of the South, South Texas, and regions of the Southwest and Great Plains likely tribal lands) have higher instances of counties with extremely high inequality. However, high inequality counties are scattered across the county, which may indicate that communities have special circumstances that can exacerbate the difference in the share of income by 20th and 80th percentile earners (Gini coefficient definition). The top 10 counties with the highest Gini coefficients in 2018 include:

  1.  East Carroll Parish, Louisiana    0.6647
  2.  Harding County, New Mexico        0.6289
  3.  Perry County, Tennessee           0.6254
  4.  New York County, New York         0.5971
  5.  Issaquena County, Mississippi     0.5841
  6.  Dickenson County, Virginia        0.5800
  7.  Leflore County, Mississippi       0.5765
  8.  Lafayette County, Arkansas        0.5762
  9.  Greene County, Georgia            0.5730
  10. Orleans Parish, Louisiana         0.5706

The map also identifies counties with significantly lower inequality levels than the national average. In particular, regions of the Southwest, Great Plains, and Midland Texas have multiple low inequality counties. Overall, it appears that inequality may be higher in the South, Southwest, Appalachia, and along the California and mid-Atlantic coasts. Inequality in general may be lower in the Midwest, Great Plains, and Central and West-Central parts of the country.
